## Course Grading & Expectations   {#grading-and-expect}


*You should keep up with the posted material throughout the  course!!*


Your grade in the course will be based on *problem sets*, two *midterm
exam* and a *final exam*.

Here are details on these course components:

- *weekly problem sets*, 

  Problem sets will be collected weekly on *Monday*. You can find the
  planned collection schedule on the course website.

  A total of 10 problem sets will be collected.

  The problems will be posted on the course website, and your
  solutions will be submitted to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) -- see [these remarks
  concerning use of
  gradescope](/course-posts/resources--gradescope.html).

- I plan to use the course-meetings on Mon and Wed for lecturing, and
  the meeting on Fri for more interactive discussions. Occasionally, I
  might have you solve a (short) problem during the Friday
  session whose solution I then collect and mark. This score will
  contribute to your "problem set" grade.

- 2 *midterms*. The midterms will be "in-class";

  - Midterm 1 - Oct 3 10:30-11:20
  - Midterm 2 - Nov 7 10:30-11:20

- 1 *final exam* 

  - Dec 15, 12:00-14:00

Please refer to the course website for details on expectations
concerning these course components.

Your score in the course will be determined from these grading components by the
following (implicit) formula:

Table: **Grading**

| grade component | percentage |
|:----------------|:-----------|
| problem sets    | 40%        |
| midterm 1       | 20%        |
| midterm 2       | 20%        |
| final           | 20%        |

-------

Your *letter grade* is then determined from this score using [the
scheme described here](https://math.tufts.edu/resources/grading-schemes).
