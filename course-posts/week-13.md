Thanksgiving! only one lecture this week.

- [lecture notes](/course-content/bridge-to-higher-math.pdf)  (Week 13 material begins on p. 95).


After the break, I plan to give one more lecture about graphs. Then
I'll give two lectures about using the computer proof assistant
[Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/) to formalize
mathematics. And then we'll have a review lecture.
