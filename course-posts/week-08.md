title   : Week 8
date    : 2025-10-20

This week, we'll continue our discussion of equivalence relations, and
we'll start a discussion of cauchy series and convergence.

I'll get the next homework posted by Tuesday. (Hopefully sometime on Monday).

- [lecture notes](/course-content/bridge-to-higher-math.pdf)  (updated. Week 8 material begins on p. 58).


- [problem set 8](/course-content/2025-10-27--ps-08.pdf)   
  [solutions](/course-content/2025-10-27--ps-08-solutions.pdf)  
  Note that there is no "problem set 7" -- I hope to keep the problem
  set numbers in sync with the week number.
